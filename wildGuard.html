    <h1 >WildGuard</h1>
    <p>India's vast forest cover, encompassing 21.54% of its total area, serves as a critical habitat for an extensive array of
        wildlife, including nearly 500 species of mammals. However, as urbanization continues to encroach upon natural
        habitats, interactions between humans and wild animals are becoming increasingly common, raising concerns about
        potential conflicts and risks. In ancient times, before the Common Era (BCE), communities relied on localized
        knowledge and rudimentary techniques to manage encounters with wild animals in residential areas, lacking the
        modern infrastructure and communication channels available today.
        Recognizing the growing importance of addressing urban-wildlife interactions, there is a pressing need for
        innovative solutions that leverage emerging technologies. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology
        presents a promising avenue for enhancing early warning mechanisms and facilitating informed decision-making
        in such scenarios. However, it is the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that truly revolutionizes our approach to
        managing these complex challenges. AI enables the development of interconnected systems capable of real-time
        data collection, processing, and analysis, empowering us to gain deeper insights into wildlife behavior and
        effectively mitigate conflicts while promoting coexistence.
        In response to this imperative, this paper proposes a comprehensive solution titled "Wild Animal Detection in
        Residential Areas Using AI". Leveraging the capabilities of AI, this system seeks to deploy a network of cameras
        and speakers strategically across residential settings to monitor and detect the presence of wild animals. Through
        intelligent data processing and analysis, the system aims to provide timely alerts to both residents and relevant
        authorities, enabling proactive measures to prevent potential conflicts and ensure community safety.
        Moreover, beyond its immediate practical applications, this proposed system also plays a pivotal role in public
        awareness and education about local wildlife. By fostering a deeper understanding of wildlife behaviors and
        habitats, it promotes a culture of coexistence and responsible behavior among residents. Additionally, it addresses
        the pressing concerns of gardening communities, where pest constraints and wildlife intrusion threaten harvests and
        safety alike. Traditionally, communities have relied on methods such as ringing trumpets, passed down through
        generations, to expel wild animals. However, the integration of AI technology offers a more sophisticated and
        effective approach to managing these challenges, ensuring the sustainable coexistence of humans and wildlife in
        residential areas.</p>
